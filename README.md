  5) Program that calculates the coefficients a and b of a straight line: y = ax + b passing through two points. The coordinates of the two points are given by the user.  
  
  6) Program that computes the volume and surface area of a cone. Radius and height are given by the user.

    Lab 2:
  1) Program that calculates he weighted arithmetic average of three grades, provided that weights are nonnegative and at least one weight is positive.
  
  2) Program that uses the switch statement to a numerical grade into a letter grade. 
  
  3) Program asks the user for the date in dd/mm/yy format and outputs it as "Dated this ___ day of ___ 20__".
  
  4) Program asks the user for the date in dd/mm/yy format and outputs which dates comes earlier in the calendar year.
  
  5) Program that calculates the area and perimeter of a triangle using Heron's formula. The user inputs the lengths of the triangle's sides.  
  
  6) Program that generates two random integers from the range [1,10] at a time e.g. 5, 7 and then asks the user "How much is 5 * 7?". After doing this 10 times, the user receives a grade based on how many out of the 10 questions were answered correctly.


    Lab 3:
  1) Program that is given two integers m and n and outputs first m multiples of n.
  
  2) Program that is given two integers m and n and outputs all positive multiples of m smaller than n.
  
  3) User is asked for one integer value n. Program outputs all even squares between 1 and n.
  
  4) Program computes the sum and arithmetic average of 10 integers given by the user using fixed length array.
  
  5) Program computes the sum and arithmetic average of n integers. n is given by the user.
  
  6) Program simplifies a fraction that is given by the user e.g. 4/18 --> 2/9.
  
  7) Program computes the greatest common diivisor of three integers.
  
  8) Program prints out the multiplication table from m to n onto the console. n and m are given by the user.
  
  9) Prints a one month calendar onto the console. User can select the month and the day of the week on which the month begins.
  
  10) User enters a positive number n and the program prints out the sum of all positive numbers smaller than n, which are relative prime with n.
  
  
    Lab 4:
  1) Program asks user for 5 integers, stores them in a dynamic array and outputs the arithmetic average of all integers different than the greatest value, sum of all integers different than the greatest value and number of all integers different than the greatest value. Elements in array are accessed using pointers.
  
  2) One-dimensional array of dimension n is filled with random integers. Program outputs all pairs of integers in the array whose sum is equal to M. n and M are given by the user.
  
  3) Program finds and displays all prime numbers equal or less than n. n is given by the user.
  
  
    Lab 5:
  1) A two-dimensional array of n rows and m columns is filled with random integers. Program displays array, the row of the array with the largest sum, the column of the array with the smallet arithmetic average and all rows of the array with at least two even values. n and m is given by the user.
  
  2) User is asked to enter numbers to fill two arrays. User specifies the length of both arrays. Program outputs a rectangular multiplication table, multiplying both arrays with each other. 
  
  3) Create a square n*n matrix and displays it on screen. User enters integer value for n. Program then outputs the sum of all values in the diagonal of the matrix, the sum of all values above the diagonal of the matrix and the sum of all values below the diagonal of the matrix.
  
  4) Create a n*m matrix and an a*b matrix. Program outputs both matrices on the screen, multiplies them with each other and outputs the result. User specifies m, n, a and b.
  
  5) Program generates a random walk across a 10*10 matrix and visually displays the walk on screen. At the beginning all elements of the matrix will be filled with a '.' character. As the program walks from element to element in the matrix, each walked over element will then be filled with a letter from 'A' to 'Z'.
  
  
    Lab 6:
  1) Program calculates the area and circumference of a rectangle. User is asked to enter all sides of the rectangle. Program checks if a rectangle can be constructed with the given sides, if so it performs the calculations for area and circumference, if not it notifies the user that two sides of equal length are needed to form a rectangle. User is askey if they want to repeat the program at the end (y/n). 
  
  2) Program generates an array with random integers using the function generateArray, displays it with function displayArray and reverses the array with function reverseArray. User specifies the length of array.
  
  3) User is asked to enter a positive integer n and outputs all factors of n and whether n is a prime number or not. 
  
  4) User is asked to enter 3 numbers and program informs the user about the average, sum and largest number. Program calls functions averageOf3, sumOf3 and largestOf3 outside the main function to do so.

  5) User is asked to enter the radius of a circle and program outputs the circumference and area of the circle by calling functions outside the main function. 
  
  6) Program asks user for a positive integer n and then calls a function that displays a triangle of '*' characters of heigth n on the left margin of the screen.
