# Cprogramming
Set of exercise solved in C

Lab 1:
  1) Program that asks the user for one integer number, one real number, one character and one C-style string and then outputs all these values given by the user.
  
  2) Program that outputs the value of a square function y=ax^2+bx+c. Values for a, b, c and x are given by the user. 
  
  3) Program asks the user for three integers. It then displays the arithmetic average and greatest value on the screen.
  
  4) Program that outputs the value of a function y=(ax+b)(cx+d). Values a, b, c, d, x are given by the user.
  
  5) Program that calculates the coefficients a and b of a straight line: y = ax + b passing through two points. The coordinates of the two points are given by the user.  
  
  6) Program that computes the volume and surface area of a cone. Radius and height are given by the user.
