# Cprogramming
Set of exercise solved in C

Lab 1:
  1) Program that asks the user for one integer number, one real number, one character and one C-style string and then outputs all these values given by the user.
  
  2) Program that outputs the value of a square function y=ax^2+bx+c. Values for a, b, c and x are given by the user. 
  
  3) Program asks the user for three integers. It then displays the arithmetic average and greatest value on the screen.
  
  4) Program that outputs the value of a function y=(ax+b)(cx+d). Values a, b, c, d, x are given by the user.
  
  5) Program that calculates the coefficients a and b of a straight line: y = ax + b passing through two points. The coordinates of the two points are given by the user.  
  
  6) Program that computes the volume and surface area of a cone. Radius and height are given by the user.

Lab 2:
  1) Program that calculates he weighted arithmetic average of three grades, provided that weights are nonnegative and at least one weight is positive.
  
  2) Program that uses the switch statement to a numerical grade into a letter grade. 
  
  3) Program asks the user for the date in dd/mm/yy format and outputs it as "Dated this ___ day of ___ 20__".
  
  4) Program asks the user for the date in dd/mm/yy format and outputs which dates comes earlier in the calendar year.
  
  5) Program that calculates the area and perimeter of a triangle using Heron's formula. The user inputs the lengths of the triangle's sides.  
  
  6) Program that generates two random integers from the range [1,10] at a time e.g. 5, 7 and then asks the user "How much is 5 * 7?". After doing this 10 times, the user receives a grade based on how many out of the 10 questions were answered correctly.
